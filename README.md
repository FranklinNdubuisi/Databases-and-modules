The databases.py script is a Python program that utilizes a custom module named mymodule. It begins by calling the Interface() function, which likely sets up an interactive environment for user interaction. Following this, the Continue() function is executed to carry out additional tasks after the interface initialization. To use this script, ensure that mymodule is present in the same directory and that Python 3.x is installed. Run the script by executing python databases.py in your terminal. This script's functionality relies on the proper implementation of mymodule to perform its intended operations.
